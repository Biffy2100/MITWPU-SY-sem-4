6. What is the difference between connection-oriented and connectionless communication? Give examples.
7. Write short notes on:
   a) ARP
      Address Resolution Protocol or ARP is a communication protocol used to find the MAC/ physical address of a device from its ip address.
      This protocol is used when a device wants to communicate with another device on a LAN or ethernet.

      Working of ARP:
      1. **Sender knows the IP address** of the device it wants to reach.
      2. **IP asks ARP** to find out the target's physical (MAC) address using its IP.
      3. **ARP creates a request** with the senderâ€™s MAC, senderâ€™s IP, and the targetâ€™s IP.
      4. **The request is sent as a broadcast** to all devices on the network.
      5. **All devices receive it**, but only the target device responds because it matches the IP.
      6. **The target sends back a reply** with its MAC address (as a unicast reply).
      7. **Sender gets the reply**, learns the targetâ€™s MAC, and now sends the actual data in a unicast frame.
   
   b) DNS
   c) HTTP
   d) SMTP
