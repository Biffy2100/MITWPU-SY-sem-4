### ✅ **Network Portion vs Host Portion**

| Aspect            | Network Portion                     | Host Portion                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Purpose**    | Identifies the **network**          | Identifies the **specific device** on that network |
| 2. **Defined by** | **Subnet mask** (1s in binary)      | Subnet mask (0s in binary)                         |
| 3. **Used by**    | **Routers** for packet forwarding   | **End devices** to recognize themselves            |
| 4. **Same for**   | All devices in the **same network** | Unique for **each device**                         |
| 5. **Example**    | `192.168.1.0` (in /24)              | `.1`, `.2`, `.3` (host addresses)                  |
