### 🔹 **Unit 5: IP Addressing – Full Theory Question Bank**

#### 📘 **Basics of IP Addressing**

1. What is an IP address? Why is it needed?
2. What are the characteristics of IPv4?
3. What is the difference between logical and physical addressing?

---

#### 🧱 **IPv4 Structure & Classes**

4. Explain the format of an IPv4 address with an example.
5. Differentiate between network portion and host portion in an IP address.
### ✅ **Network Portion vs Host Portion**

| Aspect            | Network Portion                     | Host Portion                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Purpose**    | Identifies the **network**          | Identifies the **specific device** on that network |
| 2. **Defined by** | **Subnet mask** (1s in binary)      | Subnet mask (0s in binary)                         |
| 3. **Used by**    | **Routers** for packet forwarding   | **End devices** to recognize themselves            |
| 4. **Same for**   | All devices in the **same network** | Unique for **each device**                         |
| 5. **Example**    | `192.168.1.0` (in /24)              | `.1`, `.2`, `.3` (host addresses)                  |

Let me know if you want an example explained too.

6. What are the five classes of IPv4 addresses? Give their address ranges.
7. How to determine the class of a given IP address?
8. How many networks and hosts are supported in each class?

#### 🧾 **Special Addresses**

9. What is the purpose of the loopback address?
10. What are private IP addresses? List their ranges.
11. What is the role of reserved IP addresses?

#### 🧠 **Subnetting & Masks**

12. What is a subnet mask? Why is it used?
13. How do you calculate the number of subnets and hosts?
14. What is the role of ANDing in subnetting?
15. Explain the difference between **network address, first address, last address, and broadcast address** using binary rules.
16. Define and explain **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**.
17. What is the advantage of classless addressing over classful addressing?

---

#### 💻 **Calculation-Based Theory**

18. Given an IP address and subnet mask, find the:

* Class
* Subnet mask
* Network address
* First and last usable address
* Broadcast address

21. Explain the structure and representation of an IPv6 address.
22. Write and abbreviate/unabbreviate IPv6 addresses (examples).
23. Explain **unicast, multicast, and anycast** in IPv6.

---
