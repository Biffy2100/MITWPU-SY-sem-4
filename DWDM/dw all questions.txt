29. Explain the Apriori Algorithm with an example.
The Apriori Algorithm is a popular data mining technique used to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules in transactional databases. 
It works by iteratively identifying itemsets that appear together frequently and using the "apriori property"—if an itemset is frequent, all its subsets must also be frequent.

Example:
Consider the following transactions:
T1: {Milk, Bread}
T2: {Milk, Diaper, Beer, Bread}
T3: {Milk, Diaper, Beer, Cola}
T4: {Diaper, Beer, Bread}
T5: {Milk, Diaper, Bread, Beer}

Step 1: Find frequent 1-itemsets (items that appear in at least 3 transactions, min support = 3):
- Milk (4)
, Bread (4)
, Diaper (4)
, Beer (4)
, Cola (1)

Step 2: Generate frequent 2-itemsets:
- {Milk, Bread} (3)
, {Milk, Diaper} (3)
, {Milk, Beer} (3)
, {Bread, Diaper} (3)
, {Bread, Beer} (3)
, {Diaper, Beer} (4)

Step 3: Generate frequent 3-itemsets:
- {Milk, Bread, Diaper} (3)
, {Milk, Diaper, Beer} (3)
, {Bread, Diaper, Beer} (3)

Step 4: No frequent 4-itemsets (none appear in at least 3 transactions).

The Apriori Algorithm helps identify combinations of items that frequently occur together, which can be used for market basket analysis and recommendation systems.
